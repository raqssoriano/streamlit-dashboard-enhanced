# **HHA507 || Dashboards with Streamlit**
---
---

#### **ðŸŽ¯** In this assignment, I am learning how to enhance a Streamlit dashboard by updating and modifying example code from an existing repository. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with Streamlit by creating visualizations, adding text, and integrating interactive components.

## â˜ž *Data Overview*

#### The dashboard provides weekly estimates of school learning modalities (in-person, remote, or hybrid) for U.S. K-12 public and independent charter school districts during the 2020-2021 school year (Aug 2020-June 2021) based on data from the [National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES)](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/files.asp#Fiscal:2,LevelId:5,SchoolYearId:35,Page:1).

#### Learning Modality Types:
- _*In-Person*_: All schools within the district offer face-to-face instruction 5 days per week to all students at all available grade levels.
- _*Remote*_: Schools within the district do not offer face-to-face instruction; all learning is conducted online/remotely to all students at all available grade levels.
- _*Hybrid*_: Schools within the district offer a combination of in-person and remote learning; face-to-face instruction is offered less than 5 days per week, or only to a subset of students.

##### â€¢ Other links used to perform the data visualizations: A combination of [Streamlit Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/) and **GitHub Copilot** within **Visual Studio Code**, which I modified to make it more personalized. Also, I watched several **YouTube videos** to complete the visualizations/widgets section.

## â˜ž _**Dashboard Enhancements and Interactive Visualizations**_

### âž¤ Data Visualizations Overview:

1. Total Percentage of Students in Each Learning Modality
    - **`Pie Chart`**: It shows the percentage in each learning modality.
    - **`Importance`**: It helps in understanding the proportion of students in each type and highlights the main modes of learning during the given period.

2. Total Number of Students in Each Learning Modality
    - **`Bar Chart`**: It displays the number of students in each learning modality.
    - **`Importance`**: Makes it easy to compare which modalities are most and least common.

3. Total Number of Students in Each Learning Modality by State
    - **`Grouped Bar Chart`**: It shows the number of students in each learning modality by state.
    - **`Importance`**: It allows for the comparison of the distribution of learning modalities across different states, highlighting regional differences and trends.

4. Weekly Trends in Student Learning Modalities
    - **`Line Chart`**: It displays the weekly trends in student learning modalities over time, showing how the distribution changed each week.
    - **`Importance`**: It helps identify patterns, peaks, and shifts in learning modes during the specificied period.

### âž¤ Sidebar Widgets:

- It provides innovative features for filtering and customizing data analysis. Dashboard app users can select week (date) ranges, learning modalities, states, and custom filters, allowing for a more detailed and personalized analysis of the dataset. This flexibility can significantly influence our decision-making based on the data, if necessary.
